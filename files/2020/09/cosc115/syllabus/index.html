            <li>
              The <a href="../">COSC 115 home page</a> contains general information about the course, a link to this syllabus, and a description of each project.

              <a href="https://piazza.com/wofford/fall2020/cosc115/home">Piazza</a>.
              Piazza will host announcements, descriptions of homework assignments, handouts, and discussions about class topics and projects.
              You need to create a free account.
              Use your Wofford email address for the account.
              
              If a question about <em>anything</em> related to the course arises, post it at Piazza.
              A nice thing about Piazza is that <em>any of us</em> can answer a question.
              If you can help a student, please do!
              Much of the learning I have done arose from helping other people to figure out how to do something or solve a problem.
              </p>
            <p>
              Note: You may post or respond to a post <em>anonymously</em>.
              Be aware that your post will be anonymous to classmates but not to me.

                You will submit some assignments in Moodle.
                Your grades will be recorded in Moodle.</p>
              <p>
                Note: The cumulative grade shown in Moodle <em>should</em> reflect your final weighted score under Method #1 [see below].
                Occasionally, the complexity of the Moodle grade book setup will confound me and I might set it up incorrectly.
                If you notice a problem, please let me know and I will correct it.

              You will submit projects, complete homework exercises,
              and take tests in Mimir Classroom.
              You can even use it to code your web pages.

          <h5>Hardware and software</h5>
          <p>
            You will need a computer in order to work on assignments
            and access the websites we will use.
            A laptop computer that you can bring to class is ideal.
            The computer needs a web browser and needs to be able
            to run a file transfer application that lets you copy files from
            your computer to a web server (computer).
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use other applications, too, including the ones listed below.
            These must run on your computer.
            All of them are free to download, install, and use.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I will use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> to edit files and recommend you use it, too.
              (You can use any application that supports editing text files.)
            </li>
            <li>
              We will use an image editing application to prepare images
              for use on the web.
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
              We will use <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1">FileZilla</a>
              to transfer files to/from a web server.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: <em>Wait for instructions before downloading FileZilla.</em>
              Some of the installers contain bloatware that you
              probably do not want to install.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              While you can connect to our <a href="https://zoom.us" target="_blank">Zoom</a> class meetings using a browser,
              running the <a href="https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting" target="_blank">Zoom client</a> on your computer,
              mobile phone, or tablet seems to work better.

          <p>Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for homework, projects, exams, and a personal website (semester-long project). The usual grading scale applies: 93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82: B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C, 70–72: C-, 60–69: D, 0–59: F.</p>


                        <p>
                          A final average will be calculated using two methods that apply weightings shown in the table.
                          The higher of the two calculated values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                          Under Method #2, homework scores, project scores, and exam scores do not factor into the calculation.

          <h5>Homework</h5>

          <p>
            Homework is designed to help you to be prepared for class and will be assigned regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I encourage you to work on written homework assignments with other students in the class.
            You may use any resources that are useful to you
            to complete homework assignments.
            If you&rsquo;re still struggling with a homework problem,
            post a question about it at Piazza.
          </p>


          <h5>Exams</h5>

          <p>
            Two exams will be used to assess your understanding of the concepts covered in this course.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The first exam will assess your knowledge of HTML and how to organize files on a website.</li>
            <li>
              The second exam will assess your knowledge of CSS and responsive web design concepts.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Exams will be given <em>asynchronously</em> in Mimir.
            You will have one hour to complete the exam (possibly more if you have an accommodation).
            You may use the textbook and your own notes while taking the exam,
            but you may not use any other resources or assistance from another person.
          </p>


          <h5>Projects</h5>

          <p>
            Projects give you practical experience building web pages and websites.
            Some projects will involve a single web page.
            Others can involve multiple pages.
            Most projects involve coding and will be completed as a Mimir Web Project.
          </p>


          <h5>Personal site</h5>

          <p>
            You will build a personal website over the course of the semester.
            A few weeks into the semester,
            you will submit  a proposal (wireframes and a sitemap).
            You will work on your site during the semester, updating content
            and presentation as we cover more topics.
            
            During the last week of classes you will prepare a 3-to-5-minute video
            walking me through the website and addressing specific questions
            about your site and how you developed it.
            The video will be viewed only by me.
          </p>

          <h5>Final exam</h5>

          <p>
            The final exam will cover all of the topics we covered during the semester.

                This class will run in accordance with a <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/otei/documents/models_cc2.pdf" target="_blank">Blended Synchronous (Flipped Classroom)</a>.
                You will be expected to prepare for a class meeting by performing a variety of tasks, including:
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>reading portions of a textbook</li>
                  <li>working homework problems</li>
                  <li>watching video tutorials</li>
                  <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
                

                <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/flipped_classroon.png" alt="blended synchronous model using a flipped classroom" style="width: 50%;">
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Blended</em> means that there are in-person and online activities
                  in the course for which you are responsible.
                  While there is a significant portion of the class that happens online,
                  this is not a self-paced course.
                  Assignments have fixed due dates.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  <em>Synchronous</em> means that students who are remote are actively participating
                  in class during the scheduled meeting times.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  <em>Flipped</em> means we will spend class meetings discussing readings,
                  homework problems, and working on problems and projects.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              
              <p>
                You will be in one of three groups: A, B, or C.
                Groups A and B will attend class in-person one day a week and attend class remotely one day a week.
                Students in Group C will work fully remotely.
                Students in all groups should work <em>synchronously</em> unless there are extenuating circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                During class meetings, in-person and remote students will
                work together in small teams to solve problems.
                That way in-person students can grab my attention to address issues.
              </p>

              <p>
                Social distancing allows only half of the students to be in our
                classroom at one time.
                The first day of class will be completely remote.
                On the first day we will determine whether you are in Group A or Group B.
                Group C has already been set up.
                Some of you might join Group C temporarily if necessary.
                Note: I might revise group assignments during the semester.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students in Group A will attend &ldquo;in person&rdquo; each Thursday and
                attend remotely each Tuesday.
                Students in Group B will attend &ldquo;in person&rdquo; each Tuesday and
                attend remotely each Thursday.
                The class on November 19, the last Thursday before Thanksgiving break,
                will be 100% remote.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will use Zoom to support remote access.
                The links for class meetings and for office hours will be available in Piazza
                and Moodle.
                Those will be posted in Moodle and in Piazza.
                You will need to have a Zoom account and log in to join the class meeting.
                Portions of every class meeting will be recorded and made available online.
                The videos for a class meeting will be available in a Piazza post for
                that class.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Wearing a mask covering nose and mouth in the classroom is mandatory.
                A facemask is not a substitute for social distancing.
                Do not modify the seating arrangement in the classroom.

              <p>
                Please evaluate your own health regularly. 
                Do not attend class or other on-campus events if you are not feeing well.  
                Seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness.

              <p>
                Class participation and active learning are important aspects of this class,
                so your engagement is critical to your success.
                However, I understand that sometimes you must miss examinations or other academic obligations
                affecting your grades because of illness, personal crises, and other emergencies.
                As long as such absences are not excessive (beyond two weeks of classes),
                I will work with you as best I can to help you succeed in the course.
                Contact me as soon as possible when such absences arise so we can make arrangements to get you caught up.
                This policy will not apply in the case on non-emergency absences.
              </p>
                  
              <p>
                If you will miss class on an &ldquo;in person&rdquo; day,
                please post <em>without any details</em> (anonymously if you prefer) a follow-up
                message to my Piazza post about the class
                and tag your post with
                <code>open-seat</code> so that a student in the
                other group can occupy your seat in the classroom.
                If you are in the <em>other</em> group and would like that seat
                then be the first to post in Piazza a claim for it.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you will miss a class on a &ldquo;remote&rdquo; day,
                then let me know as soon as you can.
<!--
                If you miss two classes in a row,
                either in-person or remote, without contacting me,

                You will take the final exam online in Mimir.
                You must complete the exam in the time allotted.

                I usually respond to email messages sent Sunday through Thursday within 24 hours&mdash;longer
                when sent on a Friday or a Saturday.
                I usually respond much sooner to Piazza posts since I have the <a href="https://piazza.com/product/mobile" target="_blank">Piazza app</a> on my phone and receive notifications.

            <div class="panel-body">

              <p><a href="http://catalog.wofford.edu/college/academic-program/honor-code/" target="_blank">The Honor
                Code</a> requires faculty, staff, and students to maintain a high standard of individual honor and integrity. Work represented as your own must be your own.</p>


<p>I encourage you to collaborate with others in the class&mdash;that is, help or get help from others. However, you may not write code for another student or provide code to copy.
    Doing any of these things is a violation Honor Code.
</p>
<p><em>What is the distinction between <em>collaboration</em> and <em>cheating</em>?</em>
</p>
<p>
  During collaboration,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may discuss a project with another person.</li>
  <li>You may work together to figure out how to attack a problem.</li>
  <li>You may describe an issue you are having and get suggestions for resolving it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
     Ultimately, you must implement a solution to the problem yourself.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are cheating when you copy a solution&mdash;or part of a solution&mdash;from someone else or when you allow someone to copy from you.</li>
  <li>You are cheating if you let someone else edit your code&mdash;or you edit their code.</li>
  <li>You are cheating if you are working along with another and decide together what code to write.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For some projects, you might be allowed to work with other students in the class.
  In this case, you are allowed to share all your work with your teammates.
  However, you are expected to do all of the work together.
  One student should not work without the others contributing.
</p>
<p>
<p>
Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline. Start each assignment as soon as it is given. If you run into a glitch:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Seek help from me, either by posting at Piazza or consulting with me.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit on time the work you have done, even if it is not fully completed.
    You will likely get partial credit for your work.
    Just make sure any code you submit contains no errors that prevent it from being executed.
  </li>
</ul>
