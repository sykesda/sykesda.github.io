                            Students learn to develop programs using an object-oriented language.
                              Students are introduced to problem solving and algorithm development
                              with emphasis on good programming style.
                              Completion of this course with a C or higher is a
                              prerequisite for all 300- and 400- level courses in
                              Computer Science.

                        <p>
                          The main focus of this course is to learn how to write computer programs
                          using the Python 3 programming language.
                          While you are learning Python, you are also learning about the constructs that underly most
                          computer programming languages.
                          You'll also learn how to design algorithms to solve problems, a key step in writing a program.
                          Python is a way to express an algorithm in a way that lets a computer <em>run</em> it. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                          This is a <em>programming</em> course and not really a <em>computer science</em> course.
                          This is a prerequisite for COSC 350 <i>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</i>, our first course in computer science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Computer science is the study of <em>computation</em>&mdash;what can be computed and how to compute it.
                          When a <em>computer</em> follows the steps of an algorithm coded in a programming language, the computer is doing computation.

                          After this course you will be able to write programs in Python and be a better problem solver.

                          Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for quizzes, programming projects, and a paper/presentation. The usual grading scale applies: 93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82: B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C, 70–72: C-, 60–69: D, 0–59: F.

                          A final average will be calculated using two methods based on the weightings shown in the table.
                          The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                          Under Method #2, neither homework scores nor exam scores factor into the calculation.

          <h5>Homework</h5>
          <p>
            Homework assignments help you to prepare for class and
            will usually consist of some reading in the textbook and some exercises
            (to be completed in Mimir).
            <strong>Homework is due before the start of the class
            for which it was assigned.</strong>
            Deadlines are enforced by Mimir.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homework is graded.
            Partial credit will seldom be awarded for incorrect answers to homework problems.
            If you are struggling with a homework problem,
            post a question about it at Piazza.
            You are allowed to use any resources you find useful for completing homework assignments,
            including consulting other students in the class.
          </p>



          <h5>Exams</h5>

          <p>
            You will take two exams during the semester.
            The first will be administered after we cover Chapter 12.
            The second will be administered after we cover Chapter 19.
          </p>
          <p>
            All exams will be given online (in Mimir).
            You may use your notes while you are taking the exam, but you may not use any other resources,
            including web resources and assistance from other people.
            Exams will be timed.
            You may select your start time, but you must complete the exam in the time allotted.
          </p>





          <h5>Projects</h5>

          <p>
            Projects play an important role in this course. 
            Each of the projects will give you the opportunity to write a Python program that utilizes
            what you&rsquo;ve learned so far.
            It is important that you start coding right after a project is assigned so you can get
            help if you have trouble getting started or fixing bugs.
          </p>



          <h5>Final exam</h5>

          <p>
            The final exam will assess how well you reached the objectives for the course.
<!--             Partial credit will be awarded for incorrect answers. -->
            The final exam will be given online (Mimir) and will have a time limit.
          </p>
          <p>
              You may use the textbook and your notes from this class while taking the final exam.
              You may not use any other resources, including other people.
          </p>

                This class will run in accordance with a <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/otei/documents/models_cc2.pdf" target="_blank">Blended Synchronous (Flipped Classroom)</a>.
                You will be expected to prepare for a class meeting by performing a variety of tasks, including:
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>reading portions of a textbook</li>
                  <li>working homework problems</li>
                  <li>watching video tutorials</li>
                  <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
                

                <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/flipped_classroon.png" alt="blended synchronous model using a flipped classroom" style="width: 50%;">
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Blended</em> means that there are in-person and online activities
                  in the course for which you are responsible.
                  While there is a significant portion of the class that happens online,
                  this is not a self-paced course.
                  Assignments have fixed due dates.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  <em>Synchronous</em> means that students who are remote are actively participating
                  in class during the scheduled meeting times.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  <em>Flipped</em> means we will spend class meetings discussing readings,
                  homework problems, and working on problems and projects.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              
              <p>
                You will be in one of three groups: A, B, or C.
                Groups A and B will attend class in-person one day a week and attend class remotely one day a week.
                Students in Group C will work fully remotely.
                Students in all groups should work <em>synchronously</em> unless there are extenuating circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                During class meetings, in-person and remote students will
                work together in small teams to solve problems.
                That way in-person students can grab my attention to address issues.
              </p>

              <p>
                Social distancing allows only half of the students to be in our
                classroom at one time.
                The first day of class will be completely remote.
                On the first day we will determine whether you are in Group A or Group B.
                Group C has already been set up.
                Some of you might join Group C temporarily if necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students in Group A will attend &ldquo;in person&rdquo; on Wednesday
                of the first week of classes and every other class meeting after that.
                Students in Group B will attend &ldquo;in person&rdquo; on Wednesday
                of the first week of classes and every other class meeting after that.
                The class on November 20, the Friday before Thanksgiving break,
                will be remote only.
                Check out the <a href="a-b_calendar.html">calendar</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will use Zoom to support remote access.
                The links for class meetings and for office hours will be available in Piazza
                and Moodle.
                Portions of every class meeting will be recorded and made available online.
                The videos for a class meeting will be available in a Piazza post for
                that class.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Wearing a mask covering nose and mouth in the classroom is mandatory.
                A facemask is not a substitute for social distancing.
                Do not modify the seating arrangement in the classroom.

                Please evaluate your own health regularly. 
                Do not attend class or other on-campus events if you are not feeing well.  
                Seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness.

              <p>
                Class participation and active learning are important aspects of this class,
                so your engagement is critical to your success.
                However, I understand that sometimes you must miss examinations or other academic obligations
                affecting your grades because of illness, personal crises, and other emergencies.
                As long as such absences are not excessive (beyond two weeks of classes),
                I will work with you as best I can to help you succeed in the course.
                Contact me as soon as possible when such absences arise so we can make arrangements to get you caught up.
                This policy will not apply in the case on non-emergency absences.

                If you will miss class on an &ldquo;in person&rdquo; day,
                please post <em>without any details</em> (anonymously if you prefer) a follow-up
                message to my Piazza post about the class
                and tag your post with
                <code>open-seat</code> so that a student in the
                other group can occupy your seat in the classroom.
                If you are in the <em>other</em> group and would like that seat
                then be the first to post in Piazza a claim for it.

                If you miss two classes in a row,
                either in-person or remote, without contacting me,

              <p><a href="http://catalog.wofford.edu/college/academic-program/honor-code/" target="_blank">The Honor
                Code</a> requires faculty, staff, and students to maintain a high standard of individual honor and integrity. Work represented as your own must be your own.</p>


<p>I encourage you to collaborate with others in the class&mdash;that is, help or get help from others. However, you may not write code for another student or provide code to copy.
    Doing any of these things is a violation Honor Code.
</p>
<p><em>What is the distinction between <em>collaboration</em> and <em>cheating</em>?</em>
</p>
<p>
  During collaboration,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may discuss a project with another person.</li>
  <li>You may work together to figure out how to attack a problem.</li>
  <li>You may describe an issue you are having and get suggestions for resolving it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
     Ultimately, you must implement a solution to the problem yourself.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are cheating when you copy a solution&mdash;or part of a solution&mdash;from someone else or when you allow someone to copy from you.</li>
  <li>You are cheating if you let someone else edit your code&mdash;or you edit their code.</li>
  <li>You are cheating if you are working along with another and decide together what code to write.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For some projects, you might be allowed to work with other students in the class.
  In this case, you are allowed to share all your work with your teammates.
  However, you are expected to do all of the work together.
  One student should not work without the others contributing.
</p>
<p>
<p>
Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline. Start each assignment as soon as it is given. If you run into a glitch:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Seek help from me, either by posting at Piazza or consulting with me.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit on time the work you have done, even if it is not fully completed.
    You will likely get partial credit for your work.
    Just make sure any code you submit contains no errors that prevent it from being executed.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Mimir has extensive capabilities for detecting plagiarized Python code.
  When completing a project or a coding problem on an exam, don&rsquo;t copy another student&rsquo;s code or allow another to copy yours.
