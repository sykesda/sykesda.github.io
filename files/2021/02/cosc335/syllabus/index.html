              <h5>Required textbooks</h5>

              <p>
                None.
                We will rely on web tutorials and other API documentation sites.
                A few of the sites we use might require you to create a free account.
              </p>


              <h5>Websites</h5>

              <p>
                We will use Piazza, Mimir, and Moodle regularly.
                We will use others for tutorials and such as we need them.
                Some sites might require you to create a free account.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://class.mimir.io/">Mimir Classroom</a>.
                  Homework exercises, some projects, some quizzes, and the final exam will be administered from within
                  Mimir Classroom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="piazza.com/wofford/spring2021/cosc335">Piazza</a>
                  will host announcements, descriptions of homework assignments,
                  handouts, and discussions about class topics and projects. If you have a question
                  that comes up outside of class time, post it at Piazza.
                </li>

                    You will submit some project files in Moodle. Your scores for graded work
                    (quizzes and projects) will be recorded in the Moodle gradebook, too.
                  </p>               
                  <p>
                    Note: The cumulative grade shown in Moodle <em>should</em> reflect your final weighted score.
                    Occasionally, the complexity of the Moodle grade book setup will confound me and I might set it up incorrectly.
                    If you notice a problem, please let me know and I will correct it.

              <h5>Software</h5>
              <p>
                We will use the applications listed below and possibly others.
                All of the applications are available for free.

                    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank">WebStorm</a> as our IDE for JavaScript.
                    You will need to
                    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students" target="_blank">get a student
                      account at JetBrains</a> to get a license for that will last all semester.
                      If you already have a student license for PyCharm or some other JetBrains product,
                      then your account should authorize you to use WebStorm.

              <p>Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for
                homework, exams, projects, and a final exam. The usual grading scale applies:
                93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82: B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C, 70–72:
                C-, 60–69: D, 0–59: F.</p>

              <p>
                A final average will be calculated using two methods using weightings shown in the
                table.
                The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                Under Method #2, neither homework scores nor exam scores factor into the
                calculation.
              </p>

              <p>
                  There will be twelve 5-point quizzes, one given each Tuesday, except for the day of classes.
                  A weekly quiz encourages you to keep up with the work and helps both you and me assess how well you understand
                  the topics we are covering.
                  <!-- Being able to rework a quiz by the next class meeting allows you to make sure that you will know or understand by the following Thursday what you might not know or understand on a Tuesday. <em>Take advantage of being able to rework a quiz even if you think you did well on it.</em> -->
              </p>

              <p>Quizzes will be conducted as follows.</p>

              <ol>
                  <li>
                      A quiz will start toward the end of class on Tuesday.
                      All papers must be turned in when time is called at 14:15.
                      (If you have an accommodation that calls for extra time, you may continue after time is called.)</li>
                  <li>
                      Each quiz will be worth 5 points.
                      Each of five problems is worth one point.
                      <strong>An answer to a problem must be completely correct to be awarded a point.</strong>
                      No partial credit will be given.
                      You must show your work for any problem that requires a sequence of steps to answer in order
                      to receive a point for that problem.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      A &ldquo;rework&rdquo; copy of the quiz will be made available.
                      You have an option to rework the problems on the quiz and then submit your answers
                      <strong>by the start of the next class meeting</strong>.
                      If <em>all</em> of the answers on your reworked quiz are correct,
                      then you will earn back <em>half</em> of the points that you missed on the Tuesday
                      quiz&mdash;for example, if you got 2 on Tuesday quiz and 5 on the rework quiz, then
                      3.5 will be recorded as the score for that quiz.
                      Note: You may get all of the help you need on the rework, including help from me,
                      <strong>except you may not post questions about the quiz at Piazza</strong> or other web
                      forum.
                  </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Cell phones, calculators, computer applications, web resources, or other people may not be
                used during a quiz except for ones you are directed to use.
              </p>

              <!--
<p>
Your two lowest quiz scores will be dropped and not incorporated in the quiz score component of your final score.
</p>
-->


              <h5>Coding projects</h5>
              <p>
                  Coding projects give you practical experience with what we are covering in class.
                  Coding projects will comprise 35% of your final grade.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Point values for projects will vary and will reflect the level of challenge.
                  More challenging projects will have higher point values.
                  Your coding projects score will be computed as the percentage of points earned times 35.
                  That is, I will add up all of the points you earned for coding projects and divide
                  that by the number of points that you could have earned and then multiply that ratio by 35.
              </p>
              <p>
                  To get a perfect score on a project, your submission must satisfy <em>all</em> of the requirements set forth in the project’s description and be submitted before the deadline. Often there will be a rubric available in Moodle.
                  If you&rsquo;d like to incorporate more than the required features in your code, then please do!
              </p>

              <h5>Final exam</h5>
              <p>
                  The final exam will assess what you have learned over the semester. It  comprises 15% of your grade. 
                  Part will focus on key concepts that were covered by the weekly quizzes and part will focus on your
                  ability to apply the concepts to &ldquo;real&rdquo;
                  problem situations&mdash;for example, how would you design a web application
                  given a description of requirements for it.
              </p>

              <h5>Homework</h5>
              <p>
                  Homework will be assigned regularly, but will not be collected and graded.
                  Bring your written answers to class with you.
                  I encourage you to work on homework assignments with other students in the class.
                  You may use any resources that are useful to you.

                    Evaluate your own health regularly. 
                    Do not attend class or other on-campus events if you are not feeling well.  
                    Seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness.

                    We are fortunate to be meeting in a classroom that can accommodate all of us
                    even with appropriate social distancing.
                    Consequently, all of us can attend class meetings in person starting with the second week of classes.
                    The first week classes will meet remotely using Zoom.
                  </p>
                  <p>You are expected to attend class meetings in person if you are well.
                      You must wear a mask covering nose and mouth in the classroom and sit at least six feet from others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are not well, you are expected to attend class meetings remotely via Zoom if you can.
                    The <em>General Policy Regarding Attendance</em> in
                    the <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If necessary, we will move to a <em>synchronous, blended</em> or a <em>synchronous, remote</em> model.
                    Under those models, class meetings will be held using Zoom and you will be expected to
                    be in each of those Zoom meetings.

                    Class participation and active learning are important aspects of this class,
                    so your engagement is critical to your success.
                    However, I understand that sometimes you must miss examinations or other
                    academic obligations
                    affecting your grades because of illness, personal crises, and other
                    emergencies.
                    As long as such absences are not excessive (beyond two weeks of classes),
                    I will work with you as best I can to help you succeed in the course.
                    Contact me as soon as possible when such absences arise so we can make
                    arrangements to get you caught up.
                    This policy will not apply in the case on non-emergency absences.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If you will miss class on an &ldquo;in person&rdquo; day,
                    please post <em>without any details</em> (anonymously if you prefer) a follow-up
                    message to my Piazza post about the class
                    and tag your post with
                    <code>open-seat</code> so that a student in the
                    other group can occupy your seat in the classroom.
                    If you are in the <em>other</em> group and would like that seat
                    then be the first to post in Piazza a claim for it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you will miss a class on a &ldquo;remote&rdquo; day,
                    then let me know as soon as you can.
                    
                If you miss two classes in a row,
                either in-person or remote, without contacting me,
                I will enter an attendance warning in Starfish.

                    You will take the final exam online in Mimir.
                    You must complete the exam in the time allotted.

                    Bring a charged laptop to each class meeting if you can.
                    We will often work in-class exercises using a laptop.
                    However, I will expect your laptop to be closed unless I direct you to use it.
                    Take notes on paper.
                    Your open laptop is usually a distraction not only for you,

                    If you are remote and using your laptop for a Zoom connection,
                    try to get access to a second monitor.
                    That will facilitate your being able to see what is being done via screen sharing
                    and what you will do as part of an in-class exercise.

                    If I must cancel or move office hours, I will announce the change in Piazza.

                    You do not need to make an appointment to meet with me during office hours.

                    I am usually working in my office and you can meet with me there as
                    long as we observe social distancing.
                    I will look at your computer screen by either connecting your computer
                    to my external monitor or by having you share your screen using Zoom.

                    I appreciate your contacting me during my office hours since it is time I have set

                    However, I realize that you might have conflicts.
                    You are welcome to contact me to set up an appointment.

                    Please do not ask me when I am available.

                    I usually respond much sooner to Piazza posts since I have the <a

                  <p>I encourage you to collaborate with others in the class&mdash;that is, help or
                    get help from others. However, you may not write code for another student or
                    provide code to copy.
                    Doing any of these things is a violation Honor Code.
                  </p>
                  <p><em>What is the distinction between <em>collaboration</em> and
                      <em>cheating</em>?</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Collaboration</strong>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You may discuss a project with another person.</li>
                    <li>You may work together to figure out how to attack a problem or develop an algorithm.</li>
                    <li>
                      You may describe an issue you are having, such as a bug in your code, and get suggestions
                      for resolving it.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, you must implement a solution to the problem yourself.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Cheating</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You are cheating when you copy code from someone else or when you allow someone
                      to copy from you.
                    </li>
                    <li>You are cheating if you let someone else edit your code&mdash;or if you edit
                      their code.</li>
                    <li>You are cheating if you are working along with another and decide together
                      what code to write.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    For some projects, you might be allowed to work with other students in the
                    class as a part of a team.
                    In this case, you are allowed to share all your work with your teammates.
                    However, you are expected to do all of the work together.
                    One student should not work without the others contributing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <p>
                    Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline. Start each assignment
                    as soon as it is given. If you run into a glitch:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Seek help from me, either by posting at Piazza or consulting with me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Submit on time the work you have done, even if it is not fully completed.
                      You will likely get partial credit for your work and/or an opportunity to fix
                      any problems and raise the score.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
