                  <p>
                    This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion.
                    The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
                    classmates and me.
                    Rather than emailing questions to me, post your questions on Piazza.

                  <p>
                    Note: You may post or respond to a post <em>anonymously</em>.
                    Be aware that your post will be anonymous to classmates but not to me.

                    You will submit some assignments in Moodle.
                    Your grades will be recorded in Moodle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Note: The cumulative grade shown in Moodle <em>should</em> reflect your final
                    weighted score under Method #1 [see below].
                    Occasionally, the complexity of the Moodle grade book setup will confound me and
                    I might set it up incorrectly.
                    If you notice a problem, please let me know and I will correct it.

              <h5>Hardware and software</h5>
              <p>
                You will need a computer in order to work on assignments
                and access the websites we will use.
                A laptop computer that you can bring to class is ideal.
                The computer needs a web browser.
                You will be able to write C and C++ code using the Mimir IDE.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will also need to use Microsoft Word to create a paper for this course.
                You can download it from

                weekly quizzes,
                programming projects, and a paper and presentation (semester-long project).
                The usual grading scale applies: 93â100: A, 90â92: A-, 87â89: B+,

              <h5>Weekly quizzes</h5>

              <p>
                  There will be twelve 5-point quizzes, one given each Wednesday,
                  except for the Wednesday of the first week of classes.
                  A weekly quiz encourages you to keep up with the work and helps
                  both you and me assess how well you understand
                  the topics we are covering.
                  <!-- Being able to rework a quiz by the next class meeting allows you to make sure that you will know or understand by the following Friday what you might not know or understand on a Thursday. <em>Take advantage of being able to rework a quiz even if you think you did well on it.</em> -->
              </p>

              <p>Quizzes will be conducted as follows.</p>

              <ol>
                  <li>
                      A quiz will start at 1:30 P.M. on Wednesdays.
                      All papers must be turned in when time is called at 1:45 P.M.
                      At that time you may leave the classroom.
                      If you have an accommodation that calls for extra time,
                      you may continue after time is called and others leave.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Each quiz is worth 5 points.
                      Each of five problems is worth one point.
                      <strong>An answer to a problem must be completely correct to be awarded a point.</strong>
                      No partial credit will be given.
                      You must show your work for any problem that requires a sequence of steps to answer in order
                      to receive a point for that problem.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      A &ldquo;rework&rdquo; copy of the quiz will be made available.
                      You have an option to rework the problems on the quiz and then submit your answers
                      <strong>by the start of class on the following Friday</strong>.
                      If <em>all</em> of the answers on your reworked quiz are correct,
                      then you will earn back <em>half</em> of the points that you missed on the Thursday
                      quiz&mdash;for example, if you got 2 on a Wednesday quiz and 5 on the rework quiz, then
                      3.5 will be recorded as the score for that quiz.
                      Note: You may get all of the help you need on the rework, including help from me,
                      <strong>except you may not post questions about the quiz at Piazza</strong> or other web
                      forum.
                  </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Cell phones, calculators, computer applications, web resources, or other people may be
                used during a quiz except for ones you are directed to use.
              </p>

              <!--
<p>
Your two lowest quiz scores will be dropped and not incorporated in the quiz score component of your final score.
</p>
-->


              <h5>Programming projects</h5>
              <p>
                Programming projects give you practical experience with what we are covering in class.
                Programming projects will comprise 30% of your final grade.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Point values for projects will vary and will reflect the level of challenge.
                  More challenging projects will have higher point values.
                  Your programming projects score will be computed as the percentage of points earned times 30.
                  That is, I will add up all of the points you earned for programming projects and divide
                  that by the number of points that you could have earned and then multiply that ratio by 30.
              </p>
              <p>
                  To get a perfect score on a project, your submission must satisfy <em>all</em> of the requirements set forth in the projectâs description and be submitted before the deadline. Often there will be a rubric available in Moodle.
                  If you&rsquo;d like to incorporate more than the required features in your code, then please do!
              </p>

              <h5>Paper and presentation</h5>
              <p>
                The paper and presentation will be worth 20 points (20% of your grade).
                You will receive several scores during the semester:
                a score for a first draft, a score for your review of another
                studentâs first draft, a score for your second draft, and a score for the

                    We are fortunate to be meeting in a classroom that can accommodate all of us
                    even with appropriate social distancing.
                    Consequently, all of us can attend class meetings in person starting with the second week of classes.
                    The first week classes will meet remotely using Zoom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evaluate your own health regularly. 
                    Do not attend class or other on-campus events if you are not feeling well.  
                    Seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness.  
                    A doctor's note concerning absences is not required.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You are expected to attend class meetings in person if you are well.
                    You must wear a mask covering nose and mouth in the classroom and sit at
                    least six feet from others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are not well, you are expected to attend class meetings remotely via Zoom if you can.

                    If necessary, we will move to a <em>synchronous, blended</em> or a <em>synchronous, remote</em> model.
                    Under those models, class meetings will be held in perspon and/or using Zoom.
                    You will be expected to be in each of those Zoom meetings.

                    Bring a charged laptop to each class meeting if you can.
                    We will often work in-class exercises using a laptop.
                    However, I will expect your laptop to be closed unless I direct you to use it.
                    Take notes on paper.
                    Your open laptop is usually a distraction not only for you, but for other students near you.

                    If you are remote and using your laptop for a Zoom connection,
                    try to get access to a second monitor.
                    That will facilitate your being able to see what is being done via screen sharing
                    and what you will do as part of an in-class exercise.

                    If I must cancel or move office hours, I will announce the change in Piazza.

                    You do not need to make an appointment to meet with me during office hours.
                    Just drop in via Zoom.
                    I am usually working in my office and you can meet with me there as
                    long as we observe social distancing.
                    I will look at your computer screen by either connecting your computer
                    to my external monitor or by having you share your screen using Zoom.

                    I appreciate your contacting me during my office hours since it is time I have set
                    aside and cannot easily use for another purpose.
                    However, I realize that you might have conflicts.
                    You are welcome to contact me to set up an appointment.
                    If you do, list some times that you are available.
                    Please do not ask me when I am available.
                    Or you are welcome to drop by my office if you think I might be there.

                    You are encouraged to respond to a question or to edit a response to a question.
                    We are all learning together.
                    If you send me a question via email or via private Piazza post that should be posted
                    publicly at Piazza,
                    my reply will direct you to post your question publicly.

                    <strong>Do not post working code at Piazza.</strong>
                    Do not include in a response either &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; code or a detailed
                    description of how to change code to get it to work.
                    It is okay to post non-working code.

                    I usually respond to email messages sent Sunday through Thursday within 24
                    hours. I will usually respond within 48 hours
                    to messages sent on a Friday or a Saturday.
                    I usually respond much sooner to Piazza posts since I have the <a
                      href="https://piazza.com/product/mobile" target="_blank">Piazza app</a> on my
                    phone and receive notifications.
                    However, keep in mind that teaching is my <em>job</em> and not my whole life.

                  <p>
                    You can send me email messages for private matters, such as letting me know you
                    will be absent or that you'd like to schedule a meeting.
                    However, I prefer that you post a private message via Piazza.

                  <p>I encourage you to collaborate with others in the class&mdash;that is, help or

                    <li>You are cheating if you let someone else edit your code&mdash;or if you edit
                      their code.</li>
                    <li>You are cheating if you are working along with another and decide together

                    For some projects, you might be allowed to work with other students in the
                    class as a part of a team.
                    In this case, you are allowed to share all your work with your teammates.
                    However, you are expected to do all of the work together.
                    One student should not work without the others present and contributing.

                  <p>
                    Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline. Start each assignment

                      Submit on time the work you have done, even if it is not fully completed.
                      You will likely get partial credit for your work and/or an opportunity to fix
                      any problems and raise the score.

                We will delve at first into the C programming language.
                Then we will work through the Levitin book up through Chapter 10.
                Then we will circle back to study more deeply each strategy.
