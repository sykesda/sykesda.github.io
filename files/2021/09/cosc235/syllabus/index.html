                Students learn to develop programs using an object-oriented language.
                Students are introduced to problem solving and algorithm development
                with emphasis on good programming style.
                Completion of this course with a C or higher is a
                prerequisite for all 300- and 400-level courses in
                Computer Science.

              </div>

              <p>
                One focus of this course is learning how to write computer programs
                using the Python 3 programming language.
                While you are learning Python, you are also learning about the constructs that
                underly most
                computer programming languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another focus is learning how to develop algorithms to solve problems,
                a critical step in writing a program.
              </p>
              <p>
                A programming language, such as Python,
                provides a way to express an algorithm such that a digital computer can <em>run</em>
                it.

              <p>
                You need an account for <a href="https://www.mimirhq.com">Mimir Classroom</a>.
                Accounts are free.
                Most homework assignments, projects, and tests will be completed in Mimir.
                We will set up your account during the first class meeting.
              </p>

              <h5>Piazza</h5>
              <p>
                You need an account at <a href="piazza.com/wofford/fall2021/cosc235" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.
                Accounts are free.
                We&rsquo;ll be conducting all class-related discussion here this term.
                The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails),
                the quicker you&rsquo;ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your
                classmates and instructors.
                I encourage you to ask questions when you&rsquo;re struggling to understand
                a concept&mdash;you can even do so anonymously.

                will have a link to Mimir and to Piazza.
                Scores for homework, exams, and projects will be recorded in Moodle.
                The cumulative grade shown in Moodle <em>should</em> reflect your final weighted
                score.
                If you notice a problem, please let me know and I will try to correct it.

                We will be using web-based Python integrated development environments,

                Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for quizzes,
                programming projects, and a paper/presentation. The usual grading scale applies:
                93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82: B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C, 70–72:
                C-, 60–69: D, 0–59: F.

              <!-- <p>
                A final average will be calculated using two methods based on the weightings shown
                in the table.
                The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                Under Method #2, neither homework scores nor exam scores factor into the
                calculation.

                The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                Under Method #2, the homework scores are not factored into the
                calculation, the test scores are weighted less, and the final exam is weighted more.
                Note: The Moodle Gradebook will reflect Method #1 weightings.

              <p>
                Homework assignments prepare you for class.
                An assignment usually consists of some reading in the textbook and some exercises
                (to be completed in Mimir).
                <strong>Homework is usually due two hours before the start of the class meeting
                for which it was assigned.</strong>
                Deadlines are enforced by Mimir.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are allowed to use any resources you find useful for completing homework
                assignments, including working with other students in the class.
                Your primary goal should be to get a perfect score on every homework assignment
                so you will be prepared for the next class meeting.
              </p>

                The homework component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
                weighted mean of scores:
                the percentage obtained by dividing the sum of points you earned by the sum of point values for the
                assignments.
                For example, let's say there are two assignments, the first worth 15 points and the second worth 25 points.
                If your score on the first assignment is 9 and your score on the second is 21, then your score
                for both is (9 + 21) &divide; (15 + 25) = 75%.
                Note that the result can be different from averaging the percentage scores for the two assignments,
                ((9 &divide; 15) + (21 &divide; 25)) &divide; 2 = (60% + 84%) &divide; 2 = 72%.
              </p>

              <h5>Tests</h5>
              <p>
                You will take three tests during the semester.
                The first will be administered after we cover Chapter 7.
                The second will be administered after we cover Chapter 14.
                The third will be administered after we cover Chapter 18.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may bring an index card, maximum size 6"&times;9",
                containing <em>handwritten</em> notes to each test.
              </p>


              <h5>Projects</h5>
              <p>
                The best way to learn to code is to write a lot of programs.
                Consequently, programming projects play a very important role in this course.
                Each of the projects will give you the opportunity to write a Python program that
                utilizes what you&rsquo;ve learned so far.
                It is important that you start working on a project right after it is assigned
                so you can
                get help if you have trouble getting started or fixing bugs.
              </p>

                The projects component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
                weighted mean of scores, the same method used for homework.
              </p>


              <h5>Final exam</h5>
              <p>
                The final exam will assess how well you reached the objectives for the course.
                You must be present for the final exam.

                    Most class meetings will start with a brief review of the homework assignment
                    and continue with discussions and/or exercises based on what has been covered so far.
                    Some in-class exercises will require you to work on a laptop computer or work
                    with another student in the class.
                    You may have a laptop computer open on your desk only if I direct you to use it.

                      Handwritten notes engage more of the senses.
                      The brain is more active, so the learning process is enhanced.
                      This is actually part of an area of study called “haptics.”
                      Researchers in this arena are studying the way our minds and bodies interact in the learning process.

                    It is the policy and practice of Wofford College to create an
                    inclusive and accessible learning environment.
                    This course is intended for all students,
                    including those with mental or physical disabilities, illness, injuries,
                    impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s
                    equal access to education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have not yet established services through Accessibility Services,
                    but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that keeps
                    you from fully accessing the space, content, and experience of this course,
                    you are welcome (but not required) to visit the
                    <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Accessibility Services Accomodations</span> channel

                    If you have already established accommodations with Accessibility Services, please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.
