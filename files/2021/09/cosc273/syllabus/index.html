              <h5>Software</h5>
              <p>
                We will use two computer applications:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php" target="_blank"><i>The

              </ul>
              <p>
                To run these apps, you might need to download and install Java from <a
                  href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html"
                  target="_blank">Java SE Downloads</a> if you have not already installed Java on
                your computer.
                Both applications have been installed on the Macs in the Computer Science Lab (Olin
                112A).
                Use one of the lab computers if you can&rsquo;t run it on your own computer.
                <em>Be sure you do not leave your files on a lab computer&rsquo;s storage.</em>

            <div class="panel-body">

              <p>
                Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for
                homework, tests, projects, and a final exam.
                The usual grading scale applies: 93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82:
                B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C,
                70–72: C-, 60–69: D, 0–59: F.
              </p>

              <p>
                A final average will be calculated using two methods using weightings shown in the
                table.
                The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                Under Method #2, the homework scores are not factored into the
                calculation, the test scores are weighted less, and the final exam is weighted more.
                Note: The Moodle Gradebook will reflect Method #1 weightings.

              <h5>Homework</h5>
              <p>
                Homework assignments help you to prepare for class.
                Homework will usually consist of some reading and some exercises.
                <strong>Homework is due before the start of the class meeting for which it was assigned.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                You are allowed to use any resources you find useful for completing homework
                assignments, including working with other students in the class.
                Your primary goal should be to get a perfect score on every homework assignment
                so you will be prepared for the next class meeting.
              </p>

              <p>
                The homework component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
                weighted mean of scores:
                the percentage obtained by dividing the sum of points you earned by the sum of point values for the
                assignments.
                For example, let's say there are two assignments, the first worth 15 points and the second worth 25 points.
                If your score on the first assignment is 9 and your score on the second is 21, then your score
                for both is (9 + 21) &divide; (15 + 25) = 75%.
                Note that the result can be different from averaging the percentage scores for the two assignments,
                ((9 &divide; 15) + (21 &divide; 25)) &divide; 2 = (60% + 84%) &divide; 2 = 72%.
              </p>


              <h5>Tests</h5>

              <p>
                You will take two tests.
                The first, on October 12, will cover up through <em>sequential logic</em>.
                The second, on November 11, will cover up through <em>machine language</em> and <em>computer
                architecture</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                You may bring an index card, maximum size 6"&times;9",
                containing <em>handwritten</em> notes to each test.
              </p>


              <h5>Projects</h5>

              <p>
                Projects play a central role in this course and comprise 30% of your final grade.
                It is important to complete each project successfully, working on your own.
              </p>



              <h5>Final exam</h5>

              <p>
                The final exam is comprehensive, covering the material on the first and second tests
                as well as material covered after the second test.
                The objective of the final exam is to assess how well you reached the objectives for
                the course.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may bring an index card, maximum size 6"&times;9", containing <em>handwritten</em> notes to the final exam.

                    Most class meetings will start with a brief review of the homework assignment
                    and continue with discussions and/or exercises based on what has been covered so far.
                    Some in-class exercises will require you to work on a laptop computer or work with another student in the class.
                    You may have a laptop computer open on your desk only if I direct you to use it.
                    Most projects will be started during a class meeting.

                  <p>
                    You are encouraged to take copious notes during class.
                    Take <em>handwritten</em> notes on paper or on a tablet.

                      Handwritten notes engage more of the senses.
                      The brain is more active, so the learning process is enhanced.
                      This is actually part of an area of study called “haptics.”
                      Researchers in this arena are studying the way our minds and bodies interact in the learning process.

                      including taking handwritten notes,
                      the more likely you are to remember information well.

                This is the plan for the semester.
                It is subject to change, although I will do everything I can to stay on schedule.
              </p>

              <p>
                If the schedule shows a chapter for a class meeting,
                then you should have read that chapter and completed any homework associated
                with that chapter before the start of the class meeting on that date.
                If the schedule shows a project, then we will spend at least part of the class meeting on that date 
                getting started on that project.
