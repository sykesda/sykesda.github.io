                Students are introduced to problem solving and algorithm development
                with emphasis on good programming style.
                Completion of this course with a C or higher is a
                prerequisite for all 300- and 400-level courses in
                Computer Science.

                One focus of this course is learning how to write computer programs
                using the Python 3 programming language.
                A programming language
                provides a way to express an algorithm such that a digital computer can <em>run</em>
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another focus is learning how to develop algorithms to solve problems,
                a critical step in writing programs.

                Accounts are free.
                Most homework assignments, projects, and tests will be completed in Mimir.
                <em>We will set up your account during the first class meeting.</em>

                We&rsquo;ll be conducting all class-related discussion here this term.
                The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via email messages),
                the quicker you&rsquo;ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your

                Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for quizzes,
                programming projects, and a paper/presentation. The usual grading scale applies:
                93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82: B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C, 70–72:

                A final average will be calculated using two methods based on the weightings shown
                in the table.
                The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                Under Method #2, neither homework scores nor exam scores factor into the
                calculation.

              <h5>Homework</h5>
              <p>
                Homework assignments prepare you for class.
                An assignment usually consists of some reading in the textbook and some exercises, often to be completed in Mimir.
                <strong>Homework is usually due two hours before the start of the class meeting
                for which it was assigned.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                You are allowed to use any resources you find useful for completing homework
                assignments, including working with other students in the class.
                Your primary goal should be to get a perfect score on every homework assignment
                so you will be prepared for the next class meeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                The homework component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
                weighted mean of scores:
                the percentage obtained by dividing the sum of points you earned by the sum of point values for the
                assignments.
                For example, let's say there are two assignments, the first worth 15 points and the second worth 25 points.
                If your score on the first assignment is 9 and your score on the second is 21, then your score
                for both is (9 + 21) &divide; (15 + 25) = 75%.
                Note that the result can be different from averaging the percentage scores for the two assignments,
                ((9 &divide; 15) + (21 &divide; 25)) &divide; 2 = (60% + 84%) &divide; 2 = 72%.
              </p>

              <h5>Tests</h5>
              <p>
                You will take three tests during the semester.
                The first will be administered after we cover Chapter 7.
                The second will be administered after we cover Chapter 14.
                The third will be administered after we cover Chapter 18.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may bring an index card, maximum size 6"&times;9",
                containing <em>handwritten</em> notes to each test.
              </p>


              <h5>Projects</h5>
              <p>
                The best way to learn to code is to write a lot of programs.
                Consequently, programming projects play a very important role in this course.
                Each of the projects will give you the opportunity to write a Python program that
                utilizes what you&rsquo;ve learned so far.
                It is important that you start working on a project right after it is assigned
                so you can
                get help if you have trouble getting started or fixing bugs.
                It&rsquo;s also important that you get each programming running correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The projects component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
                weighted mean of scores, the same method used for homework.
              </p>


              <h5>Final exam</h5>
              <p>
                The final exam will assess how well you reached the objectives for the course.
                You must be present for the final exam.
              </p>

                    Most class meetings will start with a brief review of the homework assignment
                    and continue with discussions and/or exercises based on what has been covered so far.
                    Some in-class exercises will require you to work on a laptop computer (if you have one) or work
                    with another student in the class.
                    You may have a laptop computer open on your desk only if I direct you to use it.

                      Handwritten notes engage more of the senses.
                      The brain is more active, so the learning process is enhanced.
                      This is actually part of an area of study called “haptics.”
                      Researchers in this arena are studying the way our minds and bodies interact in the learning process.

                      including taking handwritten notes,
                      the more likely you are to remember information well.

                    However, you may not write code for nor provide code to another student.
                    Conversely, you may not get another student write code for you or copy code from another student.

                    Mimir has a plagiarism detection feature based on <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/" target="_blank"><i>Moss</i></a>
                    that estimates the similarity of a program compared to both programs submitted by other other students&rsquo;
                    as well as code available on the internet.
                    I will utilize this tool to determine how similar submitted programs are.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      I will investigate any similarities that Moss flags above a certain threshold.
                      If there is a reason for me to suspect copying, each of the students whose programs are flagged will
                      be required to meet with me individually for a brief inquiry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      During this inquiry, I will ask questions about one or more parts of the code&mdash;what that code does and/or
                      why that code is needed.
                      Failure to answer competently will be treated as substantial evidence of plagiarism.

                      Depending on the severity of the plagiarism, the consequences will be one of the following:
                      <ul>
                        <li>half credit on the assignment</li>
                        <li>no credit on the assignment</li>

                      <p>
                      In summary, if you have written the code in a submission entirely on your own,
                      you will have no trouble answering any questions I have about that code.
                      If you copied code from other sources, then you are responsible for fully understanding,
                      and being able to explain the code you copied.
                      Failure to do so is evidence of plagiarism and will be treated as such.

                    Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline.
                    Manage your time effectively.
                    Start each assignment as soon as it is given.
                    If you run into a glitch:
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Submit on time the work you have done so far, even if it is not fully completed.
                      You will likely get partial credit for your work.
                    </li>
