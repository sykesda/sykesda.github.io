              Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for
              homework, tests, projects and labs, and a final exam.
              The usual grading scale applies: 93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82:
              B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C,
              70–72: C-, 60–69: D, 0–59: F.
            </p>

            <p>
              A final average will be calculated using two methods using weightings shown in the
              table.
              The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
              Under Method #2, the homework scores are not factored into the
              calculation, the test scores are weighted less, and the final exam is weighted more.
              Note: The Moodle Gradebook will reflect Method #1 weightings.
            </p>

            <h5>Homework</h5>
            <p>
              Homework assignments get you prepared for class.
              Homework will usually consist of some reading and some exercises.
              Be sure you read <em>actively</em>. Take notes.
              Some assignments will have you run some experiments and analyze data.
              <strong>Homework is due at the start of the class meeting for which it was
                assigned.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              You are allowed to use any resources you find useful for completing homework
              assignments, including working with other students in the class.
              Your primary goal should be to get a perfect score on every homework assignment
              so you will be prepared for the next class meeting.
            </p>

            <p>
              The homework component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
              weighted mean of scores:
              the percentage obtained by dividing the sum of points you earned by the sum of point
              values for the
              assignments.
              For example, let's say there are two assignments, the first worth 15 points and the
              second worth 25 points.
              If your score on the first assignment is 9 and your score on the second is 21, then
              your score
              for both is (9 + 21) &divide; (15 + 25) = 75%.
              Note that the result can be different from averaging the percentage scores for the
              two assignments,
              ((9 &divide; 15) + (21 &divide; 25)) &divide; 2 = (60% + 84%) &divide; 2 = 72%.
            </p>


            <h5>Tests</h5>

            <p>
              You will take two tests.
              The first test will be after we cover network basics,
              the application layer, and the transport layer.
              The second will be after we cover the network and link layers.
            </p>

            <p>
              You may bring an index card, maximum size 6"&times;9",
              containing <em>handwritten</em> notes to each test.
            </p>


            <h5>Projects</h5>

            <p>
              Projects play a central role in this course.
              You will do a <em>lot</em> of coding this semester, mostly in Python 3.
              It is important to complete each project successfully
              and for you to understand what you did in completing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember the 90-90 rule:
            </p>
            <figure class="figure" style="width: 80%; margin: 0.5em auto;">
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the
                  development time.
                  The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the
                  development time.
                </p>
              </blockquote>

              Starting early gives you time to ask questions.
              While you need to write your own code,
              having a conversation with other people facing
              the same challenges can be very useful.
              Come to office hours if you like.
            </p>

            <h5>Final exam</h5>

            <p>
              The final exam is comprehensive, covering the material on the first and second tests
              as well as material covered after the second test.
              The objective of the final exam is to assess how well you reached the objectives for
              the course.
            </p>
            <p>

                  Most class meetings will start with a brief review of the homework assignment
                  and continue with discussions and/or exercises based on what has been covered so
                  far.
                  Some in-class exercises will require you to work on a laptop computer or work
                  with another student in the class.
                  You may have a laptop computer open on your desk only if I direct you to use it.
                  Most projects will be started during a class meeting.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You are encouraged to take copious notes during class.
                  Take <em>handwritten</em> notes on paper or on a tablet.

                    Handwritten notes engage more of the senses.
                    The brain is more active, so the learning process is enhanced.
                    This is actually part of an area of study called “haptics.”
                    Researchers in this arena are studying the way our minds and bodies interact
                    in the learning process.

                  <p>
                    It’s the “tactile” or “kinesthetic” learning idea in action.
                    The more physically active you are,
                    including taking handwritten notes,
                    the more likely you are to remember information well.

                  It is acceptable to post non-working code.

                  It is appropriate to send me email messages for private matters, such as letting me know you

                  However, you may not write code for another student or provide code to copy.
                  Conversely, you may not get code from another student.

                  In this case, you are allowed to share all your work with your teammate.
                  However, you are expected to do all of the work together.
                  One student should not work without the other present.
                  However, one of you may meet with me without the other being present.

                <p>
                  Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline.
                  Manage your time effectively.
                  Start each assignment as soon as it is given.

                    Submit on time the work you have done, even if it is not fully completed.
