                Students learn to develop programs using an object-oriented language.
                Students are introduced to problem solving and algorithm development
                with emphasis on good programming style.
                Completion of this course with a C or higher is a
                prerequisite for all 300- and 400- level courses in
                Computer Science.

              </div>

              <p>
                The main focus of this course is to learn how to write computer programs
                using the Python 3 programming language.
                While you are learning Python, you are also learning about the constructs that
                underly most
                computer programming languages.
                You&rsquo;ll also learn how to design algorithms to solve problems, a key step in
                writing a program.
                Python is a way to express an algorithm in a way that lets a computer <em>run</em>
                it.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is a <em>programming</em> course and not really a <em>computer science</em>
                course.
                (COSC 350 <i>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</i> is the
                first <em>real</em> course in computer science.)

                Computer science is the study of <em>computation</em>&mdash;what can be computed and
                how to compute it.
                When a <em>computer</em> follows the steps of an algorithm coded in a programming
                language,
                the computer is doing computation.

                After this course you will be able to develop algorithms to solve problems and then
                translate those algorithms to Python so a digital computer can execute the algorithm.

                &copy;2021, ISBN 978-1-60797-910-4.
                I do not make any money from your purchase of this book.
              </p>

              <h5>Mimir Classroom</h5>

              <p>
                You need an account for <a href="https://www.mimirhq.com">Mimir Classroom</a>.
                Accounts are free.
                Most homework assignments, projects, and tests will be completed in Mimir.
              </p>

              <h5>Piazza</h5>

              <p>
                You need an account at <a href="piazza.com/wofford/spring2021/cosc235" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.
                Accounts are free.
                We&rsquo;ll be conducting all class-related discussion here this term.
                The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails),
                the quicker you&rsquo;ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your
                classmates and instructors.
                I encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand
                a concept&mdash;you can even do so anonymously.
              </p>

              <h5>Moodle</h5>

              <p>
                The <a href="https://moodle.wofford.edu/course/view.php?id=12254"
                  target="_blank">COSC 235A Moodle course page</a>
                will have a link to Mimir and to Piazza.
                Scores for homework, exams, and projects will be recorded in Moodle.
                The cumulative grade shown in Moodle <em>should</em> reflect your final weighted
                score.
                If you notice a problem, please let me know and I will try to correct it.
              </p>


              <h5>Zoom</h5>

              <p>
                We will use Zoom for meeting remotely, sometimes during class meetings and sometimes for office hours.
                Portions of class meetings will be recorded and then be made available on the web.
                I encourage you to install the app on your computer and/or mobile device
                instead of using a web browser.
                If you have a spare computer monitor, then I recommend your using it to extend the
                desktop on your laptop computer so you can view the screen being shared while also viewing
                a separate window on your computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The same meeting ID and password will be used for each class meeting all semester.
              </p>
<!-- 
              <h5>Python</h5>

                Your grade for the course will be based on a weighted average of scores for quizzes,
                programming projects, and a paper/presentation. The usual grading scale applies:
                93–100: A, 90–92: A-, 87–89: B+, 83–86: B, 80–82: B-, 77–79: C+, 73–76: C, 70–72:
                C-, 60–69: D, 0–59: F.
              </p>

              <!-- <p>
                A final average will be calculated using two methods based on the weightings shown
                in the table.
                The higher of the two values will be mapped to a letter grade.
                Under Method #2, neither homework scores nor exam scores factor into the
                calculation.

                A final average will be calculated using the weightings shown
                in the table.
                If at some point we are forced to switch to remote-only learning then
                the weightings for the tests and the final exam might be revised.

              <h5>Homework</h5>
              <p>
                Homework assignments help you to prepare for class and
                will usually consist of some reading in the textbook and some exercises
                (to be completed in Mimir).
                <strong>Homework is usually due two hours before the start of the class
                  for which it was assigned.</strong>
                Deadlines are enforced by Mimir.
              </p>
              <p>
                Homework is graded.
                Partial credit will seldom be awarded for incorrect answers to homework problems.
                If you are struggling with a homework problem,
                post a question about it at Piazza.
                You are allowed to use any resources you find useful for completing homework
                assignments,
                including consulting other students in the class.
              </p>
              <p>
                The homework component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
                weighted mean of scores:
                the percentage obtained by dividing the sum of points you earned by the sum of point values for the
                assignments.
                For example, let's say there are two assignments, the first worth 15 points and the second worth 25 points.
                If your score on the first assignment is 9 and your score on the second is 21, then your score
                for both is (9 + 21) &divide; (15 + 25) = 75%.
                Note that the result can be different from averaging the percentage scores for the two assignments,
                ((9 &divide; 15) + (21 &divide; 25)) &divide; 2 = (60% + 84%) &divide; 2 = 72%.
              </p>

              <h5>Tests</h5>

              <p>
                You will take two tests during the semester.
                The first will be administered after we cover Chapter 12.
                The second will be administered after we cover Chapter 19.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tests will be given in Mimir or on paper.
                You may use an index card containing notes while taking a test on paper.
                You may use your notes and the textbook while you are taking a test in Mimir,
                but you may not use any other resources,
                including web resources, apps on your computer, and assistance from other people.
                Tests will be timed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The average of the two test scores will be used in computing the final weighted score.
              </p>


              <h5>Projects</h5>

              <p>
                The best way to learn to code is to write a lot of it.
                Consequently, projects play an important role in this course.
                Each of the projects will give you the opportunity to write a Python program that
                utilizes what you&rsquo;ve learned so far.
                It is important that you start coding right after a project is assigned so you can
                get help if you have trouble getting started or fixing bugs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The projects component of the final weighted average is computed using a simple
                weighted mean of scores, the same method used for homework.
              </p>



              <h5>Final exam</h5>

              <p>
                The final exam will assess how well you reached the objectives for the course.
                <!--             Partial credit will be awarded for incorrect answers. -->
                The final exam will be most likely be given online (Mimir) and will have a time limit.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may use your index card, the textbook, and your notes from this class while
                taking the final exam.
                You may not use any other resources, including other people.

                    We are fortunate to be meeting in a classroom that can accommodate all of us
                    even with appropriate social distancing.
                    Consequently, all of us can attend class meetings in person starting with
                    the second week of classes.
                    The first week classes will meet remotely using Zoom.

                  <p>
                    Evaluate your own health regularly. 
                    Do not attend class or other on-campus events if you are not feeling well.  
                    Seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness.  
                    A doctor's note concerning absences is not required.

                  <p>
                    You are expected to attend class meetings in person if you are well.
                    You must wear a mask covering nose and mouth in the classroom and sit at
                    least six feet from others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are not well, you are expected to attend class meetings remotely via Zoom
                    if you can.

                    If necessary, we will move to a <em>synchronous, blended</em> or a <em>synchronous, remote</em> model.
                    Under those models, class meetings will be held in person and/or using Zoom.
                    You will be expected to be in each of those Zoom meetings.

                    Bring a charged laptop to each class meeting if you can.
                    We will often work in-class exercises using a laptop.
                    However, I will expect your laptop to be closed unless I direct you to use it.
                    Take notes on paper.
                    Your open laptop is usually a distraction not only for you, but for other students near you.

                  <p>
                    If you are remote and using your laptop for a Zoom connection,
                    try to get access to a second monitor.
                    That will facilitate your being able to see what is being done via screen sharing
                    and what you will do as part of an in-class exercise.

                    If I must cancel or move office hours, I will announce the change in Piazza.

                    You do not need to make an appointment to meet with me during office hours.
                    Just drop in via Zoom.
                    The same meeting ID and password will be used for each instance of office hours.
                    (They are different from the ones used for class meetings.)
                    I am usually on campus during office hours and you can meet with me in my office as
                    long as we observe social distancing.
                    I will look at your computer screen by either connecting your computer
                    to my external monitor or by having you share your screen using Zoom.

                    However, I realize that you might have conflicts.
                    You are welcome to contact me to set up an appointment.
                    If you do, list some times that you are available.
                    Please do not ask me when I am available.

                    You are encouraged to respond to a question or to edit a response to a question.
                    We are all learning together.
                    If you send me a question via email or via private Piazza post that should be posted
                    publicly at Piazza,
                    my reply will direct you to post your question publicly.

                    <strong>Do not post working code at Piazza.</strong>
                    Do not include in a response either &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; code or a detailed
                    description of how to change code to get it to work.
                    It is okay to post non-working code.

                    I usually respond to email messages sent Sunday through Thursday within 24
                    hours. I will usually respond within 48 hours
                    to messages sent on a Friday or a Saturday.
                    I usually respond much sooner to Piazza posts since I have the <a
                      href="https://piazza.com/product/mobile" target="_blank">Piazza app</a> on my
                    phone and receive notifications.

                    You can send me email messages for private matters, such as letting me know you
                    will be absent or that you'd like to schedule a meeting.
                    However, I prefer that you post a private message via Piazza.

                    Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline. Start each assignment
                    as soon as it is given. If you run into a glitch:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Seek help from me, either by posting at Piazza or consulting with me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Submit on time the work you have done, even if it is not fully completed.
                      You will likely get partial credit for your work and/or an opportunity to fix
                      any problems and raise the score.
                    </li>
