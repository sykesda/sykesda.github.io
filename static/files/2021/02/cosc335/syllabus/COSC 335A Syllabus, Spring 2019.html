  <p>
      Weighting projects at 35% and quizzes at 50% might seem unusual because students spend a lot more time on projects than they do on quizzes. However, there are at least two good reasons for this weighting:
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>Not all of the important topics covered in the course are associated with coding projects. Consequently, assessment of a student&rsquo;s understanding of a concept must be done in a way other than coding.</li>
      <li>A student&rsquo;s successful completion of code for a project is not necessarily an indication that the student has mastered a concept. Students can get help with coding. Unfortunately, some accept help with a primary goal of getting code working. They sometimes do not reflect carefully on the help they received to make sure they understand what they were doing wrong.</li>
  </ol>
-->
                        <!-- </div> -->

                        <h5>Weekly Quizzes</h5>

                        <p>
                            There will be twelve 5-point quizzes, one given each Thursday, except for Thursday of the first week of classes. A weekly quiz encourages you to keep up with the work and helps both you and me assess how well you understand the topics we are covering.
                            Being able to rework a quiz by the next class meeting allows you to make sure that you will know or understand by the following Tuesday what you might not know or understand on a Thursday. <em>Take advantage of being able to rework a quiz even if you think you did well on it.</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>Quizzes will be conducted as follows.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                A quiz will start toward the end of class on Thursday.
                                All papers must be turned in when time is called at 14:15.
                                (If you have an accommodation that calls for extra time, you may continue after time is called.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each quiz will be worth 5 points. It will have five problems, each worth one point. <strong>An answer to a problem must be completely correct to be awarded a point.</strong> No partial credit will be given. You must show
                                your work for any problem that requires a sequence of steps to answer in order to receive a point for that problem.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You will be given a &ldquo;rework&rdquo; copy of the quiz in class. You have an option to rework the problems on the quiz and then submit your answers <strong>by the start of class on the following Tuesday</strong>. If
                                all of the answers on your reworked quiz are correct, then you will earn back <em>half</em> of the points that you missed on the Thursday quiz&mdash;for example, if you got 2 on Thursday quiz and 5 on the rework quiz, then
                                3.5 will be recorded as the score for that quiz. Note: You may get all of the help you need on the rework, including help from me, <strong>except you may not post questions about the quiz at Piazza</strong> or other web
                                forum.

                        <h5>Coding projects</h5>

                        <p>
                            Coding projects give you practical experience with what we are covering in class. Coding projects will comprise 35% of your final grade.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Point values for projects will vary and will reflect the level of challenge. More challenging projects will have higher point values. Your coding projects score will be computed as the percentage of points earned times 35. That is, I will add up
                            all of the points you earned for coding projects and divide that by the number of points that you could have earned and then multiply that ratio by 35.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To get a perfect score on a project, your submission must satisfy <em>all</em> of the requirements set forth in the project’s description and be submitted before the deadline. Often there will be a rubric available in Moodle.
                            If you&rsquo;d like to incorporate more than the required features in your code, then please do!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Project code must be submitted in <a href="https://moodle.wofford.edu/moodle/course/view.php?id=9400">Moodle</a>. If Moodle is unavailable when you try to submit, then post a note about unavailability at Piazza and submit your
                            project as soon as you can after Moodle becomes available again. Submissions delayed by Moodle&rsquo;s unavailability will not be considered to be late submissions. I will accept projects up to 24 hours late, but will assess
                            a 10% late penalty <em>unless you contact me at least 24 hours before a deadline and I give you an extension.</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I will occasionally give you feedback about a project in Moodle that extends an offer to improve your score. Make sure you look at any feedback I provide.
                        </p>


                        <h5>Final exam</h5>

                        <p>
                            The final exam will assess what you have learned over the semester. It will be worth 15 points (15% of your grade).
                            Part will focus on key concepts that were covered by the weekly quizzes,
                            part will focus on things you did in coding projects,
                            and part will focus on your ability to apply the concepts to &ldquo;real&rdquo;
                            problem situations&mdash;for example, how would you design a web application given a description of requirements for it.
                        </p>


                        <h5>Homework</h5>
                        <p>
                            Homework will be assigned regularly, but will not be collected and graded.
                            I encourage you to work on written homework assignments with other students in the class.
                            You may use any resources that are useful to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You are expected tocomplete homework assignments before the start of the
                            class for which the assignment is due.

                                    I appreciate an email message or phone call letting me know in advance you will be absent.
                                    Make-up quizzes are not available for an unexcused absence.
                                    If you miss taking a quiz for an <em>unexcused</em> absence,
                                    then you are still eligible to submit a reworked quiz on Tuesday morning.
                                    If you have an <em>excused</em> absence,
                                    contact me <em>before</em> the quiz for a way to handle a missed quiz.
                                    Keep in mind that the two lowest quiz scores are dropped.

                                <p><a href="http://www.wofford.edu/uploadedFiles/studentLife/Honor%20Code_RightsResp.pdf">The Honor Code</a> requires faculty, staff, and students to maintain a high standard of individual honor and integrity. Work represented
                                    as your own must be your own.</p>

                                <p>How does the Honor Code apply to this course?</p>

                                <p>Writing a program is similar to writing an essay in that you are creating an original work based on your own thinking. Two authors might have the same ideas to express in an essay, but they are unlikely to express those
                                    ideas in exactly the same way—that is, using the same words, sentence structure, or development. Similarly, two programmers might come up with the same algorithm to solve a problem, but are unlikely to write exactly
                                    the same code. Two students in this course should not produce identical code for a program. “Identical” is reflected by a comparison of program <em>structure</em>, not necessarily by an exact comparison of the text
                                    (names, spacing, comments etc.) of a program.</p>

                                <p>You must do your own work on in-class quizzes and coding projects. However, collaboration with others on coding projects is sometimes necessary and beneficial. For this course, collaborating with others along
                                    the guidelines below is permitted and not considered a violation of the Honor Code:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>You may collaborate with others to develop an algorithm in pseudocode, but not in Python or C++.</li>
                                    <li>You may not copy code from another student nor may you allow another student to copy your code. In particular, copying another person's code with minor modifications in an attempt to obfuscate copying is a breach of
                                        academic integrity. Do not even let another student read your code for the purpose of determining what should go in his code.</li>
                                    <li>You may work with others to debug code. They may help you and you may help them, but the author of the code must maintain control of the mouse and keyboard and is responsible for understanding why any changes to the
                                        code fix the bugs. If you get significant help from others, acknowledge their help in program comments.</li>
                                </ul>


                                <p>You will occasionally be given an opportunity to pair program on a project. When pair coding, you and one other student in the class comprise an individual with respect to The Honor Code. However, <em>both of you must work together on the code</em>.
                                    This means that you are both present and actively engaged when coding. Only one of you doing all of the coding will be considered an Honor Code violation.</p>

                                <p>I encourage you to work with other students on homework and to collaborate as necessary to develop and debug code. Please contact me for help. If you are struggling with any aspect of the course, contact me and we will
                                    figure out a course of action.</p>
