                  <p>
                    This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion.
                    The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
                    classmates and me.
                    Rather than emailing questions to me, post your questions on Piazza.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Note: You may post or respond to a post <em>anonymously</em>.
                    Be aware that your post will be anonymous to classmates but not to me.

                    Moodle.
                    You will submit some assignments in Moodle.
                    Your grades will be recorded in Moodle.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>


              <h5>Hardware and software</h5>
              <p>
                You will need a computer in order to work on assignments and access the websites we will use.
                A laptop computer that you can bring to class is ideal.
                You will be able to write C and C++ code using the Mimir IDE.
                However, you may also use an IDE running on your own computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will also need to use Microsoft Word to create a paper for this course.
                You can download it from

                weekly quizzes,
                programming projects, and a paper and presentation (semester-long project).
                The usual grading scale applies: 93â100: A, 90â92: A-, 87â89: B+,

              <h5>Weekly quizzes</h5>

              <p>
                  There will be twelve 5-point quizzes, one given each Wednesday,
                  except for February 9.
                  A weekly quiz encourages you to keep up with the work and helps
                  both you and me assess how well you understand the topics we are covering.
              </p>

              <p>Quizzes will be conducted as follows.</p>

              <ol>
                  <li>
                      A quiz will start at 1:30 P.M. on Wednesdays.
                      All papers must be turned in when time is called at 1:45 P.M.
                      At that time you may leave the classroom.
                      If you have an accommodation that calls for extra time,
                      you may continue after time is called for another 7&frac12; minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Each quiz is worth 5 points&mdash;.
                      Each of five problems on a quiz is worth 1 point.
                      <strong>An answer to a problem must be completely correct to be awarded a point.
                      You must show your work for any problem that requires a sequence of steps to answer.</strong>
                      No partial credit will be given&mdash;it&rsquo;s &ldquo;all or nothing.&rdquo;                    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      A &ldquo;rework&rdquo; copy of the quiz will be made available shortly after Wednesday&rsquo;s class meeting ends.
                      You have an option to rework the problems on the quiz and then submit the <em>rework quiz</em>
                      <strong>at the start of class on the following Friday</strong>.
                      If you earn a 5 on a reworked quiz,
                      then you will earn back <em>half</em> of the points that you missed on the Wednesday
                      quiz&mdash;for example, if you got 2 on a Wednesday quiz and got a 5 on the rework quiz, then
                      3.5 will be recorded as the score for that quiz. Otherwise, the score stays at 2.
                      Note: You may get all of the help you need on the rework, including help from me.
                      You may not merely copy answers from other students unless you can explain the answer to me.
                      <strong>Do not post questions about the quiz at Piazza</strong>.
                  </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Cell phones, calculators, computer applications, web resources, or other people may not be
                used during a quiz except for ones you are directed to use.
              </p>

              <!--
<p>
Your two lowest quiz scores will be dropped and not incorporated in the quiz score component of your final score.
</p>
-->


              <h5>Programming projects</h5>
              <p>
                Programming projects give you practical experience with what we are covering in class.

                  Point values for projects will vary and will reflect the level of challenge.
                  More challenging projects will have higher point values.
                  The programming projects portion of your grade is based on the simple mean of scores:
                  I will add up all of the points you earned for programming projects and divide
                  that by the number of points that you could have earned.
              </p>
              <p>
                  To get a perfect score on a project, your submission must satisfy <em>all</em> of the requirements
                  set forth in the projectâs description and must be submitted by the deadline.
                  If you&rsquo;d like to incorporate more than the required features in your code, then please do!
              </p>

              <h5>Paper and presentation</h5>
              <p>
                Being able to communicate in writing and in speech is important.
                You will write a paper about an algorithm you developed to solve a problem.
                You will receive several scores on the paper during the semester:
                a score for your first draft, a score for your second draft, and a score for your
                <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/final%20draft" target="_blank">final
                draft</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the final exam period, you will present your paper to the class.
                A rubric for the presentation will be provided in advance.

                    Post questions and comments about this course on the Q&amp;A page at Piazza.
                    You are encouraged to respond to a question or to edit a response to a question.
                    We are all learning together.
                    If you send me a question via email or via private Piazza post that should be posted
                    publicly at Piazza,
                    my reply will direct you to post your question publicly.

                    <strong>Do not post working code at Piazza.</strong>
                    Do not include in a response either &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; code or a detailed
                    description of how to change code to get it to work.
                    It is okay to post non-working code.

                    I usually respond to email messages sent Sunday through Thursday within 24
                    hours. I will usually respond within 48 hours
                    to messages sent on a Friday or a Saturday.
                    I usually respond much sooner to Piazza posts since I have the <a
                      href="https://piazza.com/product/mobile" target="_blank">Piazza app</a> on my
                    phone and receive notifications.
                    However, keep in mind that teaching is my <em>job</em> and not my whole life.

                  <p>
                    You can send me email messages for private matters, such as letting me know you
                    will be absent or that you'd like to schedule a meeting.
                    However, I prefer that you post a private message via Piazza.

                    Mimir has a plagiarism detection feature based on <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/" target="_blank"><i>Moss</i></a>

                      be required to meet with me individually for a brief inquiry.

                      In summary, if you haveÂ written the code in a submission entirely on your own,
                      you will have no trouble answering any questions I have about that code.
                      If you copied code from other sources, then you are responsible for fully understanding,
                      and being able to explain the code you copied.
                      Failure to do so is evidence of plagiarism and will be treated as such.

                    Don&rsquo;t cheat because you are up against a deadline. Start each assignment
                    as soon as it is given. If you run into a glitch:

                    <li>
                      Submit on time the work you have done, even if it is not fully completed.
                      You will likely get partial credit for your work and/or an opportunity to fix
                      any problems and raise the score.

                We will delve at first into the C programming language.
                Then we will work quickly through the first parts of Chapters 1 through 10 of the Levitin book.
                Then we will circle back to study more deeply each strategy covered by those chapters.
                Along the way, we will work on your paper.
